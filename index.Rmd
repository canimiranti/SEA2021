## Motivation:

-  A remarkable track of poverty alleviation and economic growth over past two decades at the national level (BPS-Statistics Indonesia)
--

- Poverty rate has attenuated from 40.10 percent to 15.40 percent during 1976-2009 (Teguh and
Nurkholis, 2011)
--

- The challenges to achieve SDG's Goal 1
--

- There is still scarcity on poverty studies in Indonesia employing new district-level dataset and evaluate spatial effects (geography matters) 
--

## Research Objective:

- Examine the existence of spatial clusters and find out the location of clusters 
- Examine the existence of poverty convergence across districts
- Evaluate the spatial effects on catching-up process in poverty reduction
- Investigate the determinants of regional poverty convergence across districts in Indonesia

## Methods:

- Spatial dependence analysis  (Anselin,1995;2007)
--

- Spatial econometric (Elhorst, 2003)
--


## Data:

- Three poverty indicators (Foster et.al.,1984;Sen,1976)
--

- Related determinants : economic structure, society structure, policy structure (Miranti,2005;2011)
--

- 514 districts over the 2010-2018 period

## Main Results:

1. **Spatial clusters exist** in both poverty indicators and the determinants. 
--

2. **Hot-spots in Eastern part of Indonesia** and **Cold-spots in Western part of Indonesia**
--

3. **Persistent East-West dichotomy** 
--

4. **Spatial effect significantly affects the catching-up process**

5. **Considerable differences in the speed of convergence among three poverty indicators**

5. **Mean years of schooling contributes the largest effect to the catching-up process in poverty reduction**

# Outline of this presentation

1. Some stylized facts

  - Poverty rate across provinces
  - Poverty gap index across islands

2. Non-spatial and Spatial Convergence Framework

  - Global convergence test (intuition)
  - Spatial models and spatial convergence models

3. Main results of the paper

  - Hot-spots and cold-spots; persistent West-East dichotomy
  - Slight spatial (neighbourhood) effect
  - Spatial Durbin Model is the best specification model

# Concluding Remarks

- The presence of spatial dependence globally and locally across 514 districts in Indonesia
--

- Poverty convergence does exist in both non-spatial and spatial panel approach

- Role of neighbourhood (spatial effect) is significant in altering the speed of catching-up process in poverty reduction
--

- Educational variable and economic-related variables help to accelerate the catching-up process of poverty reduction in Indonesia.

--


## Implications and further research
--

- Recommended policy should incorporate inter-regional development strategies
--

- Developing well-constructed educational-based infrastructure and
economic hubs
--

- Combination of social protection-based policy and accessible infrastructure:
  - Next extension: (Re)evaluate the composition of convergence clubs using subnational data, which is to be constructed using satellite nightlight data.

- Next extension for further research
  - Re (evaluate) infrastructure and financial decentralization variables to observe the more comprehensive effects of policy variables.
  - The application of Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to evaluate the role of spatial heterogeneity.
